.TH CHAN 1
.SH NAME
chan \- substitute in files
.SH SYNOPSIS
chan [FILES] FROM TO
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH STATUS
0 on success and 1 when it prints the help message.
.SH EXAMPLES

.SH "SEE ALSO"
Could be replaced with a simple for loop, but if you're too tired to
this yourself everytime, chan could be the right thing for you.
.SH BUGS
Normally, ed only accepts basic regular expressions, but extended
regular expressions would be nice for FROM and TO. Workaround: use
another version of ed (9base for example).
.SH AUTHOR
Some bastard spent too much time hacking this together. I heard his
e-mail address is a.regenfuss@gmx.de.
