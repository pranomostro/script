.TH CHAN 1
.SH NAME
\fBchan\fR \- substitute in files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBchan\fR [FILES] FROM TO

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchan\fR is a utility to substitute regular expressions in files matching a regular expression.
The first argument for \fBchan\fR is a basic regular expression for the files where the substitution should apply. The second argument specifies the ed-replacement-expression. FILES is an optional argument
for a basic regular expression matching all the files where the substitution should apply.

.SH EXAMPLES
\fBchan ".*\.asm" "\<\([0-9]A-Fa-f]\+\)h" "0x\1"\fR changes the style of the hexadecimal numbers in all file having the extension 'asm'.

.SH STATUS
0 on success and 1 when it prints the help message.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
Could be replaced with a simple for loop, but if you're too tired to
this yourself everytime, chan could be the right thing for you.
.P
\fBregex(7)\fR is a good place to learn about basic and extended regular expressions, as well as \fBed(1)\fR.

.SH BUGS
Normally, ed only accepts basic regular expressions, but extended
regular expressions would be nice for FROM and TO. Workaround: use
another version of ed (9base for example).
