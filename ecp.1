.TH ECP 1
.SH NAME
\fBecp\fR \- somehow extended cp

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBecp\fR FROM TO

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBecp\fR is a simple wrapper for cp, using basic regular expressions.
I takes two arguments: FROM is an expression that determines the files that have to be copied, TO is a sed-replacement expression for the target file. If the target already exists, ecp exits with an error message.

.SH EXAMPLES
\fBecp '\\(.*\\)\\.sh$' '\\1.1'\fR was used during the creation of ecp, and copies every file with the extension '.sh' to the the corresponding file with the extension '.1'.

.SH STATUS
0 on success, 1 when it prints the help message, and 2 if it is asked to replace an already existing file.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBregex(7)\fR for the form of FROM, and \fBsed(1)\fR for the style of TO, \fBemv(1)\fR and \fBerm(1)\fR.
.SH BUGS
Ecp only accepts basic regular expressions and exits if it is asked to replace an existing file, instead of just continuing. This is arguably wrong.
