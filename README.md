About the nonsense you are looking at
=====================================

You should probably not be using this.
Look around: there are millions of alternative
implementations of batch renaming programs, including
rename from the util-linux package, zmv, and various other
graphical and curses based ones. So, go and use
something else.

Okay. You are now thinking: Why are you even publishing
this if you don't want anybody to use this?
Good question. I like oranges.

Requirements
============

You need the plan 9 shell rc, the standard unix
shell sh (for the makefile) and some version of make installed.
A coreutils similar software should be installed as well,
but emv and ecp are very modest with that.

Installation
============

Well, it is done by
	make

License
