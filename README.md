Small scripts
=============

These are just some little scripts that do not deserve becoming
own programs. In a very distant future, it is possible that I will
write some proper documentation for them (man-pages) and
in installation script (a makefile).

Until then, this is the most accurate description of what these
shell scripts do.

Some of these are very specialised, some quite general.
The wmutils/ directory contains some wmutils specific scripts.

------------

wmutils scripts:

* barign: wait until X has fully started and then ignore the bar.
* barinfo: print system information so that it can be processed by lemonbar
	is system specific with the brightness, depends on ell
* beau [w|h] [WIN]: resizes a window conforming to the golden ratio
* big [WIN]: resize a window so that it leaves a gap of the correct width at the side
* cnt [WIN]: center the current window, needs wmutils
* wsch [SIZE] [WIN]: change window size without moving the middle of the window

Requirements
------------

Generally, some base utilities (coreutils, sbase+ubase) are required.
Many of these scripts are written in the rc scripting language, the plan 9 shell.
It is needed as well.
The wmutils scripts need wmutils/core installed, barign needs wmutils/opt (for wname).

Installation
------------

Just copy these into your path.
