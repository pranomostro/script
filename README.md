Small scripts
=============

These are just some little scripts that do not deserve becoming
own programs. In a very distant future, it is possible that I will
write some proper documentation for them (man-pages) and
in installation script (a makefile).

Until then, this is the most accurate description of what these
shell scripts do.

Some of these are very specialised, some quite general.
The wmutils/ directory contains some wmutils specific scripts.

Requirements
------------

Generally, some base utilities (coreutils, sbase+ubase) are required.
Many of these scripts are written in the rc scripting language, the plan 9 shell.
It is needed as well.

Installation
------------

Just copy these into your path.
