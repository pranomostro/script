What the Heck?
==============

Yeah. That is the right thing to think.  Look at the man page.

I am sorry, I am tired of writing README's at the moment.  I'll just

mg FILES gives FILES generic names, generated by gen.

Not more, not less, not pg.

License and Thanks
------------------

I took the only sane license (flamewar incoming):
the MIT/X11 license. Have fun.

I would like to thank my past self that it wrote this document
and I can do interesting things now, like, writing new code
instead of documentation.

Have fun, future self!
