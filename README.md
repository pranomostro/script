Why?
====

This is just a very simple script for
an incremental backup solution that can
be hacked together in half an hour.
It simply copies all files from a directory
structure which were modified after another
file was modified (for example the list .tar.gz backup fileâ€¦).

Requirements
============

For using cgdc, you need rc installed. This can
be easily done by installing 9base or a standalone
version of rc.
You also need make for the installation, but I do not
see a problem here.

Installation
============

Well, lets see:
	make
should suffice.

License and Thanks
